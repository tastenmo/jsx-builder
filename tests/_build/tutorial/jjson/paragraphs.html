<Section id="paragraphs" level="1" source="/data/dev/spienx/jsx-builder/tests/sites/tutorial/paragraphs.rst" line="2" title="Paragraphs"><p>In reStructuredText (reST), paragraphs are the fundamental elements of a document. To create a paragraph, simply write the text without any special formatting.</p>
<p>However, to distinguish one paragraph from another, make sure there is a blank line between them.</p>
<p>Each paragraph is treated as a separate block of text, and reST will automatically format it accordingly.</p>
