<Section id="table-of-contents id1" level="1" source="/data/dev/spienx/jsx-builder/tests/sites/tutorial/table_of_contents.rst" line="4" title="Table of Contents"><p>The <cite>toctree</cite> directive is a powerful feature in reStructuredText (reST) used to automatically generate a Table of Contents (TOC) in Sphinx-based documentation.</p>
<p>The TOC serves to organize your documentation in a hierarchical structure and creates navigation links to different sections and subsections. This greatly improves readability and usability, making it easier for users to navigate the content.</p>
<Section id="basic-usage" level="2" source="/data/dev/spienx/jsx-builder/tests/sites/tutorial/table_of_contents.rst" line="11" title="Basic Usage"><p>For instance, if you have the following directory structure for your documentation:</p>
<CodeBlock language="text">docs/
├── index.rst
├── introduction.rst
├── installation.rst
├── usage.rst
├── chapters/
│   ├── chapter1.rst
│   ├── chapter2.rst
│   ├── chapter3.rst</CodeBlock><p>To add a <cite>toctree</cite> to an <cite>.rst</cite> file, you can follow this basic format:</p>
<CodeBlock language="restructuredtext">.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2
    :caption: Contents
    :glob:

    introduction
    installation
    usage
    chapters/*</CodeBlock><p>Explanation of the Fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>.. toctree::</strong>
This is the directive that marks the start of the Table of Contents. It tells Sphinx to include the sections listed under it in the TOC.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>:maxdepth:</strong>
The <cite>:maxdepth:</cite> option controls the depth of the TOC, which refers to how many levels of sections and subsections to include.
- For example, <cite>:maxdepth: 1</cite> will only include the top-level sections.
- Setting <cite>:maxdepth: 2</cite> will include the second-level sections (subsections) as well.
- This helps to control how much of the document hierarchy is displayed in the TOC.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>:caption:</strong>
The <cite>:caption:</cite> option sets the title of the TOC. In the example, <cite>:caption: Contents</cite> will give the TOC the title “Contents”. You can change this to any title you prefer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>:glob:</strong>
The <cite>:glob:</cite> option enables the use of wildcard patterns (like <cite>*</cite>) to match multiple files.
- For instance, <cite>chapters/*</cite> matches all <cite>.rst</cite> files within the <cite>chapters</cite> directory, including <cite>chapter1.rst</cite>, <cite>chapter2.rst</cite>, and <cite>chapter3.rst</cite>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Listed Files/Sections:</strong>
After the <cite>toctree</cite> directive, the filenames (without the <cite>.rst</cite> extension) are listed. These files will be included in the TOC and linked to the corresponding sections in your documentation.
- Example: <cite>introduction</cite>, <cite>installation</cite>, <cite>usage</cite>, and <cite>chapters/*</cite> will be added to the TOC.
- Files in subdirectories can be included by specifying the relative path.</p></li>
</ul>
